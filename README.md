##Fallout 4 Terminal Hacking Tool

###Description
#####A small application to hack Fallout 4 terminals  

This application was created as I was annoyed with Fallout 4 password mini games.
Actually, the game is very simple (much simple that it was in the previous versions).

The algorithm shows very good results and mostly solves the puzzle in 4 turns.

Below is histogram of solution probabilities depending of amount of tries.

| TRY |          PROBABILITY |
|-----|:--------------------:|
|   0 |                   0% |
|   1 |==>              6.6% |
|   2 |=======>        33.3% |
|   3 |============>   46.7% |
|   4 |===>            13.2% |
Tested with 7 letters words.
